Bcrypt: its a library which we are using in Node JS for encrypting some data using some Hashing Algorithm.

We can use this majorly for convering our passwords into some encryped form like  some random value

if my Password is: Sonam@123: ahd32456789sdas4567890hj6789

its not not in a redable form and no one can attack and we can improve the security of our Data.

How to use This?

npm i bcrypt
----------------------

bcrypt.hash(value, saltKey)

this method will generate one hash key for the given value.

bcrypt.compare(userInput, Encrypted)

if both mathes then it will return true otherwise it will return false.

==============================================================================
To implement this we have created 

one model(user.js)
one Controller (user_controller.js) for login and register Logics
one route (user_routes.js) for path of register and login
one config.js file for DB connectivity

created one Server file where include express server

include Connectityfile inside the server
included routes using app.use method

routes are linked with Controller and controllers are using Model for DB operations.
