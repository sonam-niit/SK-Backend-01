Install nodejs with default steps only by clicking in next --> next and then finish.

Once the installation finished.

open cmd (command prompt) and execute below mentioned command

>node -v
>npm -v

to check the versions of node and npm
----------------------------------------------------

REPL

-- Read evaluate print loop

every time read the data, run it and print the result and continue with the process untill the use exits from the same.

if you want to open node REPL then execute node command in your cmd

you will be able to access REPL now

so enter diffrent values
>"hellow World"
>"45+78"
>89+90
>56>90
>89>12
>89/7

to exit from the same
press ctrl+c twice.

==========================================================================================
previously all the JS code which you have written executed in HTML

means my JS scripts embedded with HTML and executed in Browser.

With the help of node we can execute out JS code in our system as server without any browser's help.

How?

we create files with .js extentiona and we will run them in terminal with the help of Node command.

How to work with node js project

step 1: whenever you want to create a project, first create a configuration file called package.json

	---> folder name, description, main file name, scripts, author name, version
	
	how to create this file?

	--> npm init 

	--> npm init -y

step 2: unserstand npm : node package manager

	npm is a repository having so many bundles of packages available with it.

	npmjs.com is free repository through you can serach all your packages and unserstand how it works.

	> npm install package-name

	>npm i package-name

	once you install the package it will update package.json file too.

	once the package installed successfuly you can see... package-lock.json file and node_modules folder in your project folder.

	>node_modules folder contains all libraries and all the codes which are related to package which you have installed.

	>package-lock.json: it contains the registry locations from where the dependencies downloaded.

If you share your code to someone or upload on git hub repository node module folder was ignored.
--> if you want to run that project in your system then just execute command npm i
so it will download all the dependencies based on the locak file and create node_modules folder again.

if lock file was deleted the package.json file can download the new dependies based on the dependencies included in package.json file.

--> it will cretate again new lock file and node_modules folder.
=====================================================================================

here the dependencies which are installed called local installation some times if you seach on google

you can see the command like

npm install express --save (to install locally)/ npm install express

but with latest version of node: write --save or not write it means same only.

some times if you see --save-dev (depelopment dependencies means its is used for only development purpose not for production)

=========================================================================================

install dependencies globally.

-- npm install nodemon -g 

(it will install the dependency globally, it will install the package in the c drive nodejs folder where you have installed node means that command you can execute any where.)

once it is installed you can execute below command from any location in your system
>nodemon --version

usually it is not suggested to install packages globally for your projects because if it update everytime, it may impact on your previously created projects.

good practice is install packages locally.

==========================================================================

npm install express (or) npm install express --save

(both are same, perviously we are using save for local installation but after version 14v of node automatically it will install locally)

---------------
suppose you want use some dependencies only for development like test my code, those dependencies we should install in dev dependencies.

npm install jasmine --save-dev (it will install in development dependencies)
