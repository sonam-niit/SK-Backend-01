For Image Upload we will use multer package which is available on npmjs.com and then we will do file upload.

npm i express multer nodemon mongoose cors

install express: creating APIs

multer: image upload

nodemon: restrating server automatically

mongoose: DB connectivity.

cors: cross origin resourse sharing (to access our backend from Frontend like React)
