Modules in Node JS:
-----------------------------------
they can be simple/ complex which basically combines similar kind of functionalities in one file or combination of multiple files.

create once and reuse it whenever its required.

Modules: diffrent types in NodeJS

1. Local Modules: which we will create by our own
	that we can simply use to our other files.
2. Core (In built) Modules: (fs,http, url,path,os)
   const url=require('url')
3. Third Party Module:
	(available on that npmjs.com 
	we can just download by using npm install command)
	once it is installed we can use it by including in out pages.

	express, nodemon, mongodb, mongoose, body-parser,bootstrap
	

============================================================================================

MJS file
----------------
module Javascript file

setting up a perfular folder structure and we can do simple emport and export of our modules using .mjs files.


How to work with this?

step 1: create package.json file using below command
	> npm init -y

step 2: create one file called mydata.mjs

	export function displayData(data){
    	console.log("Following is the Data")
    	console.log("=============================");
    	console.log(data)
	}

	(here we have just exported a function using export keyword)

step 3: create a file called myfile.js (to import mjs file)

	import {displayData} from './mydata.mjs';

	displayData({message:"Welcome to export import concept"})

if you run node myfile.js then it will give you an error called module Not found.

	to resolve this open open package.json file and include "type":"module"

	save and check your output again.

if you dont want to run big commands in terminal you can set scripts in package.json and just run npm scriptname

	"start": "node usefile.js",

	--- run command
	>npm start
