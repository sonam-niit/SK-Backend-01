How to work with some dummy server to understand API
------------------------------------------------------------

npm install json-server -g

(install globally)

create file called data.json and paste below mentioned code.

{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "luv",
      "email": "luv@gmail.com"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Krishna",
      "email": "krish@gmail.com"
    }
  ]
}

save your file now go to the terminal

execute below command

>json-server data.json

(it will start your json server and you can see in console like use this url to work with apis)
http://localhost:3000/users

you can open POSTMan tool and check diffrent methods to understand how it works.

get method: http://localhost:3000/users

get method: http://localhost:3000/users/2 (change Ids)

POST method: http://localhost:3000/users

pass json object from raw data

{
    "id":3,
    "name":"Krishna"
}

click on send so it will store this data in your JSON file.

similarly trigger

delete method :http://localhost:3000/users/2

it will delete the object with Id 2

you can see the quick reflection in your JSON file.
